    <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
</center>
    <br>
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the technology that allows machines and computers to replicate human intelligence.
    <ul>
        <li>Enables systems to perform tasks that require human-like decision-making, such as learning from data, identifying patterns, making informed choices and solving complex problems.</li>
        <li>Improves continuously by utilizing methods like machine learning and deep learning.</li>
        <li>Used in healthcare for diagnosing diseases, finance for fraud detection, e-commerce for personalized recommendations and transportation for self-driving cars. It also powers virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, chatbots for customer support and manufacturing robots that automate production processes.</li>
    </ul>
    Although the term is commonly used to describe a range of different technologies in use today, many disagree on whether these actually constitute artificial intelligence. Instead, some argue that much of the technology used in the real world today actually constitutes highly advanced machine learning that is simply a first step towards true artificial intelligence, or “general artificial intelligence” (GAI).<br>
    Yet, despite the many philosophical disagreements over whether “true” intelligent machines actually exist, when most people use the term AI today, they’re referring to a suite of machine learning-powered technologies, such as Chat GPT or computer vision, that enable machines to perform tasks that previously only humans can do like generating written content, steering a car, or analyzing data. <br>
